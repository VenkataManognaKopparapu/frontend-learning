Holy Grail Layout

Problem
Create a classic "Holy Grail" layout with header, footer, navigation, main content, and sidebar.
What i understood 
A header at the top spanning the full width
A footer at the bottom spanning the full width
A navigation section on the left with fixed width
A main content area in the center that expands to fill available space
A sidebar on the right with fixed width

Solution 
My approach 
Step 1: Started with Header and Footer
Step 2: Added Navigation Structure
